# alignment-quiz

A simple CLI project intended to run a Quiz to determine user's "alignment" as per the TTRPG game Pathfinder. Quiz has branching paths from each choice, 
where the next question in a scenario is related to the user's previous choice in order to simulate a "Choose-your-own" adventure style game. Currently 
only one scenario available.

Next Steps:
Complete Documentation
Write additional scenarios for players
Migrate project from CLI to Browser-Based application
